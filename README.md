# These are my configurations for nvim
#### Always WIP ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯

Most likely this config won't work for you if you just clone it because there is so much local stuff.
But feel free to use it as a reference and copy configs or code snippets you like.

All the configurations for plugins are in `/lua/configs/`.
General settings (options, mapping, plugins) are directly in `/lua/`.
In `vimhelp` there are some custom helpfiles which I can display with a local plugin.

### Features
